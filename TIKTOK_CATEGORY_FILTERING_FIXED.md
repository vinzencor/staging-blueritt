# 🎉 TikTok Trends Category Filtering - FIXED!

## ✅ Problem Identified & Solved

### The Issue
When users selected a category in TikTok Trends, the API was returning "zero products available" instead of showing trending products for that category.

### Root Cause
The TikTok Creative Center API returns products with the field `url_title` as the product identifier, NOT `product_id` or `id`. The backend transform function was filtering out all products because it couldn't find a valid product ID.

**API Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "url_title": "Perfume",
  "comment": 1610,
  "cost": 239000,
  "post": 3850,
  "first_ecom_category": {
    "id": "601450",
    "value": "Beauty & Personal Care"
  }
}
```

Notice: NO `product_id` or `id` field!

### The Fix
**File:** `staging-api.ezyplus.in/reverce/products/views.py`

**Changed the product ID fallback chain:**
```python
# BEFORE (filtered out all products):
product_id = (product.get('product_id') or
             product.get('id') or
             '')

# AFTER (uses url_title as fallback):
product_id = (product.get('product_id') or
             product.get('id') or
             product.get('url_title') or
             '')
```

### Test Results
